# Strategic Partnership Discussion: Accelerating Orisha's Transformation

## Executive Summary
**Orisha's Transformation**: 
- 75 products (‚Ç¨3.7M average revenue each) across 5 verticals, 
- maintaining ‚Ç¨300M revenue and 50,000+ customer relationships during an ambitious 18-month modernization journey.

**Reality Check**: 
- Only 3% cloud adoption, 45% multi-tenant architecture, 
- with complex international expansion needs across French, Dutch, and Spanish-speaking markets.

**Partnership Opportunity**: 
- Collaborate to de-risk and accelerate transformation through shared expertise, complementary capabilities, and strategic alignment.

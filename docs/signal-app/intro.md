# Signal Product Analysis: Overview, Personas, and User Flows

## 1. High-Level Overview

### What is Signal?

Signal is Advise Technologies' solution for substantial shareholding disclosure. The software functions as a notification system for filing threshold violations based on market-enriched customer holding, security, portfolio, and trade files. The application also provides user-defined Warning thresholds that serve as an early warning system before a regulatory filing notification is required.

### Core Purpose and Target Users

Signal is designed for financial institutions, investment firms, and asset managers who need to comply with substantial shareholding disclosure regulations across multiple jurisdictions. The software helps these organizations monitor their holdings against regulatory thresholds, receive alerts when thresholds are approached or breached, and facilitate the required regulatory filing process.

### Key Functionality

Signal allows users to:

- Load and process data (holdings, securities, portfolios, trades) on an automated or ad-hoc basis
- Set custom Warning thresholds below regulatory filing thresholds
- Aggregate data as required by regulations and specific reporting structures
- View Warnings and Violations that occur after alerts are triggered
- View historical holdings, including previous Warnings and Violations
- Take actions on alerts (Acknowledge, Dismiss, Mark as Filed, or File)
- Access regulatory rules and key compliance information across jurisdictions
- View filing summary information per jurisdiction
- Proceed with the filing process for relevant regulatory authorities
- Automate email notifications to distribution lists

### Technical Architecture

Signal is a hosted web application that can be accessed via `signal.advisetechnologies.com`. The application appears to have:

- A daily data processing engine
- Rule evaluation systems
- Automated email notifications
- Regulatory filing generation capabilities
